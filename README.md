# Predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success

**Dataset Description**
This project focuses on a dataset obtained from a higher education institution. The dataset comprises information about students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees, including agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The dataset encompasses details available at the time of student enrollment, such as academic path, demographics, and socio-economic factors. Additionally, it includes the academic performance of students at the end of the first and second semesters. The main objective of this project is to develop classification models for predicting students' dropout and academic success. The problem is formulated as a three-category classification task, characterized by a significant class imbalance.

**Repository Contents**
The repository consists of the following components:

- **Data:** This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis. It includes a CSV file named "student_data.csv" that contains all the required information about the students.
